## Design decisions

Images are base64 and javascript is inline because of some strange canvas constructs which don't allow external data sources which can happen when using CDNs or other stuff.

I chose middleman because there are great sensible defaults, but there's no reason this couldn't be a single page html file.

## Extras

### Add fonts

Include your own fonts in `stylesheets/_fonts.scss`

Fonts are handled with sizes as variables in the javascript and can be [added here](https://github.com/voxmedia/meme/blob/master/source/partials/_javascripts.html.erb#L8)

### Add watermark

Convert an svg to base64 and [add here](https://github.com/voxmedia/meme/blob/master/source/partials/_javascripts.html.erb#L8)
